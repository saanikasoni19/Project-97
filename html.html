        <h4>
            Hello again, dear coder. I see that you have chosen to learn HTML. I knwo you must that a
            THOUSAND questions. How do I know. Because so did I, when I was learning HTML. The question that
            bothered me the most was, "What does 'HTML' stand for"? Well, it stands for Hyper Text Markup
            Language. I leart HTML first, the CSS, and then Javascript. No, with no more waiting, let's start
            CODING!
        </h4>
        <h4>
            The first thing you should know is what you do in HTML. Well, In HTMl, you add elements,
            like buttons, text, inputs, etc.
        </h4>
        <h4>
            When you start coding in HTML, you should start with the HTML tag which looks like &lt;html&gt;.
            I call it opening html tag. At the end of all you code in the html file, you have to end with
            the ending html tag, which looks like &lt;/html&gt;. I call it ending html tag. An OPTIONAL tag
            to put AFTER the opening html tag is the head tag with looks like this, &lt;head&gt;. Of course
            this also has and ending tag which looks like &lt;/head&gt;. INSIDE the head tags, another
            OPTIONAL tag to put is the title tag which looks like &lt;title&gt;. You should ONLY put it
            inside the head tag. It also has a closing tag which looks like &lt;/title&gt;. Not all of the
            tags in HTML have and ending tag. One thing to know isthat in between the opening and ending
            tag of html is where you put all of your code. So after the html beginning tag, or after the head
            closing tag, is where you will put body. The body is where you basically put the most important
            elements in like the text, and buttons, etc. It looks like this,&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;.
            Inside the body tags, you put in the text. There are seven different tags to put in text. The
            first six look like this. &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;,
            &lt;h4&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;, &lt;h6&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;. The h1 is the biggest,
            and the h6 is the smallest. The other text tag is the paragraph tag wihcih looks like this,
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;. In between the closing and opening of the text tag is where you'll put
            your text.
            <h4> Here is an example of code.</h4>
        </h4>
        <h4>&lt;html&gt;</h4>
        <h4>&lt;head&gt;</h4>
        <h4>&lt;title&gt;</h4>
        <h4>Hello</h4>
        <h4>&lt;/title&gt;</h4>
        <h4>&lt;/head&gt;</h4>
        <h4>&lt;body&gt;</h4>
        <h4>&lt;h1&gt;</h4>
        <h4>I am amazing</h4>
        <h4>&lt;/h1&gt;</h4>
        <h4>&lt;/body&gt;</h4>
        <h4>&lt;/html&gt;</h4>
