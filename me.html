            Hello again, dear reader. I see you are interested learning more about me. I am flattered. If you
            are reading this, I thank you for visiting my beautiful website. On both of the other pages(If
            you read them), you leart some stuff about me. Well, in this page, you get to learn EVEN MORE
            about your dear app creater. Now, I will certainly not tell you my name, cause, private info, 
            and I don't want people somehow hacking me. Now, go ahead, make fun. But I'm just paranoid.
            But... I can tell you my hobbies. So are weird, others... not so much. For one thing, I love to 
            read. Like... I am obsessed with reading. My top three fave series are Keepers of the Lost Cities
            Aru Shah, and Wings of Fire. I also of to collect colors. I don't mean by just snatching up
            something colorful, and puting in a collection. what I mean is on my laptop, I have a note, on 
            which I type in colors, and their respective RGB numbers. I use then colors for CSS, or just
            messing aroubd, creating more colors. You can learn alot of RGB, and how it incorporates into 
            CSS. But I'm not going to explain this in my CSS page because that is more advanced concept, 
            and even I don't fully understand it. I LOVE to ride my bike, and I have some sort of odd 
            disabilitly. Ever since I came back from my aunt's house 4 years ago, I haven't been able to 
            sleep peacefully. I always have to do some sort of ritual which NO ONE knows about, so keep my
            secret, okay. It is called Insomia. I thought it was going away last year, but it came back a few 
            weeks ago, and I am forced to stay up late though. I read when I can't sleep though, so it isn't 
            TOO bad. I think this is a truckload of info, so maybe, I will create another app. See you soon!
