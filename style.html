    Cascading Style Sheets/CSS
    </h1>
    <div id="output3" class="container">
        <h4>
            Hello again, dear designer. I see that you desided you have to learn CSS. I know you must that a
            A LOT of questions. How do I know. Because I did to, when I was learning HTML. The question that
            I had the most was, "What does 'CSS' stand for"? Well, it stands for Cascading Style Sheets. If I 
            do sat so myself, My favorite is CSS. I love colors, and messing around with them to create new
            colors. I love designing things, so CSS was basically... created for me. Now, without further ado, 
            let us get started
        </h4>
        <h4>
            You've probably already guess it, but anyway, in CSS, you design the elements that you created
            HTML. That is why I ALWAYS do the HTML coding FIRST so I know which elements do design in 
            which way. 
        </h4>
        <h4>
            In CSS the first thing you do is choose an element from the HTML code do design first. I usually 
            do the body first, because it takes up the entire screen. If you already read the HTML part, 
            I will just say that you DO NOT design the HEAD and the TITLE. It won't show up. If you want to
            add a background to the body, You will first type in body. as in the name of the element which 
            is body. Then you will open the curly brackets{}. Inside the curly brackets, you will type
            background or background-color, depends on the platform you're using. Then after typing that, you 
            will put in the colon which looks like : . after the colon you will put in thc color you want,
            and then after the color, you will put a semi-colon, which looks like ; . Why do we put the 
            semi-colon? To close the line. It you want to change the size of the text in the h1 tag, 
            You will create a h1 section as well, instead of putting it in the body section. You will 
            basically type h1, curly brackets{}, font-size, colon:, size of the text you want(You might want
            to try some different sizes), then px(for pixels), and semi-colon;,
        </h4>
        <h4> Here is an example of code.</h4>
        <h4>body {</h4>
            <h4>background-color:aqua;</h4>
            <h4>text-align:center;</h4>
        <h4>}</h4>
        <h4>h1{</h4>
            <h4>font-size:90px;</h4>
            <h4>color:black;</h4>
            <h4>}</h4>
        <h4>Click the Main Page button to go and click on the HTML button read the HTML page! Or click 
            the other button to learn more about me!
        </h4>

        <button id="mainPage2" onclick="mainPage()">Main Page</button>
    </div>

</body>
